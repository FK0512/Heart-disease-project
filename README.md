## Project Overview
This project develops a predictive model to classify whether a patient has heart disease based on clinical features. The workflow includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Training & Evaluation
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Performance Metrics Analysis

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle - Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset).

**Dataset Features:**
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type (cp)
- Resting blood pressure (trestbps)
- Serum cholesterol (chol)
- Fasting blood sugar (fbs)
- Resting ECG results (restecg)
- Maximum heart rate achieved (thalach)
- Exercise induced angina (exang)
- ST depression induced by exercise (oldpeak)
- Slope of peak exercise ST segment (slope)
- Number of major vessels (ca)
- Thalassemia (thal)
- Target (0 = no disease, 1 = disease)
